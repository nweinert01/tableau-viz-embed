## Project 2 ##
Student Performance Analysis: Exploring Demographic and Academic Trends

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of student performance data to uncover how various demographic, socioeconomic, and preparatory factors influence academic achievement in math, reading, and writing. This project demonstrates key data analysis, visualization, and interpretation skills to inform educational support strategies and decision-making.

## 📊 Project Goals

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and outliers in student performance.

Investigate relationships between academic scores and variables such as gender, parental education, lunch status, ethnicity, and test preparation.

Visualize key insights using Tableau dashboards to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Reflect on how data-driven insights can support equitable learning interventions and improve student outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Tableau Public (for visualizations)
- Excel / Google Sheets (for data cleaning)
- Python / R (optional for preprocessing)
- GitHub (for portfolio hosting)

## 📁 Dataset Information
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams
Students Performance in Exams Dataset on Kaggle
Author: SP Scientist
License: Public Domain (Open Dataset)

Access:
Available as a downloadable CSV file on Kaggle. Requires a free Kaggle account.

## Variables Used:

gender: Student gender (male, female)

race/ethnicity: Categorical group labels (Group A–E)

parental level of education: Highest education level of the parent

lunch: Type of lunch (standard or free/reduced)

test preparation course: Whether the student completed a prep course

math score, reading score, writing score: Academic scores out of 100

## Analysis Overview

Descriptive statistics to profile the dataset.

Distribution and comparative analysis across gender, race/ethnicity, and parental education.

Test preparation impact analysis on subject scores.

Data visualizations in Tableau to highlight disparities, averages, and trends.

Filterable dashboards for user-interactive exploration by demographic variables.


📌 Key Insights
Patterns in performance by parental education level.

Differences in achievement between students with free/reduced vs. standard lunch.

Average score comparison based on test prep course completion.

Intersectional trends—e.g., how race and gender together influence outcomes.


## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for educational and portfolio purposes only. The visualizations and interpretations are my own. This dataset is synthetically generated and intended for educational purposes only. It does not represent real student records and should not be interpreted as evidence of real-world disparities.

## 🚧 Future Plans

Future Plans
Incorporate machine learning models (e.g., regression or classification) to predict performance outcomes.

Perform deeper subgroup analysis (e.g., comparing intersections of lunch type and ethnicity).

Apply the same workflow to real-world educational datasets to validate insights.

Write a portfolio blog post detailing the end-to-end process, including Tableau dashboards and how findings can support equity in education.

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I'm an educator transitioning into data analytics with a passion for education, emotional well-being, and student development. This project is part of my beginner portfolio as I build foundational skills in data analysis, storytelling and visualization.
